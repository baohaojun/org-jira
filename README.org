*Note*: @ahungry is the new maintainer of org-jira, as I myself have
not used Jira the last couple of years, and he has shown me his love
for org-jira with this pull request:
https://github.com/baohaojun/org-jira/pull/52. Thanks @ahungry!

The new project is here: https://github.com/ahungry/org-jira.

Thanks to all org-jira users. â™¥

* org-jira mode

Use [[http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/overview/][Jira]] in Emacs org-mode.

For usage, please watch [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Sp3h1Qlf4w][this youtube video]]. Or watch it on [[http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNDc1NTIwOTY0.html][youku]] if
you can't visit youtube for some reason. My apologies beforehand if
you find the video too verbose and boring.

To save the settings in your .emacs, you need only do 2 things:

1. Set the ~defcustom~ variables defined in jiralib.el (actually only
   the =jiralib-url= is required, as the other 2 are usually computed
   from it correctly and is the case in the video demo):

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    3 matches for "\bdefcustom\b" in buffer: jiralib.el
         55:(defcustom jiralib-host ""
        107:(defcustom jiralib-wsdl-descriptor-url
        120:(defcustom jiralib-url
    #+END_EXAMPLE

2. Write your password in =~/.authinfo=, with machine being the
   (computed) jiralib-host, and the port being 80 (even if you are
   using https for Jira):

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   machine JIRALIB-HOST login USERNAME password XXXXX port 80
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   If you do not set USERNAME here, then it will be prompted using the
   minibuffer; if you set the wrong username/password, then it won't work.



** External libraries

The [[http://code.google.com/p/emacs-soap-client/source/checkout][emacs-soap-client]] package is required, I used to bundle it
together with org-jira (because I had a patch for adding comments in
Chinese), but [[https://github.com/baohaojun/org-jira/issues/8][tarsius]] pointed out to me it is not a good idea. So
please install that package along with org-jira.

About the patch, I have submitted it [[http://code.google.com/p/emacs-soap-client/issues/detail?id=16&colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Owner%20Summary][upstream]]. You can download it
from the [[http://emacs-soap-client.googlecode.com/issues/attachment?aid=160000000&name=0001-Patch-for-soap-client.patch&token=0w4_XPg-Fe9sNqcTqgNP5RTXlXY%3A1359427017708][attachment url]] if it is not accepted yet.

Update: the issue has been fixed by the author, and I've learned from
him that emacs-soap-client is bundled with GNU Emacs itself now, and
he will push the fix into it. So we just need to wait a bit more.

** Commands supported

Here is the list of commands supported by org-jira, with a simple help
(the first line of elisp doc). It is created with *C-h a org-jira
RET* :-)

You can *C-h f* on each command to get more detailed help, or just
read my ugly source code:-)

This plug-in is greatly inspired by [[https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog][org2blog]].

The [[http://code.google.com/p/emacs-soap-client/source/checkout][emacs-soap-client]] is the underlying library used to communicate
with Jira. This project provided a sample jira2.el and I started with
that file.

This readme is written using org-mode itself.
